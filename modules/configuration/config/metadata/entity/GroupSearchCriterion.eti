        A component used as part of a larger search criteria entity. Encapsulates the information
        entered by the user to restrict the search to particular group or to a particular group and
        its sub-groups. One GroupSearchCriterion entity will be used for each field that needs to
        be restricted. For example if a search criteria was being constructed to specify searches for
        an entity which had two different group fields, then the search criteria would probably
        contain two separate GroupSearchCriterion components.
