    Configuration controlling behavior of syncing from Address Book. Use this file to specify which exportable
    properties in platform are to be ignored when syncing. By default, all exportable properties are synced.
    Properties that exist in this application's definition of Contact but not in the Address Book should be
    specified here.

    Note: This file should only be used for platform. If you have application specific configuration, then you
          should override the corresponding contact-sync-config.xml in your application. Since this file is
          shared by all the applications which do not override, any change here must be compatible for the
          other applications.
